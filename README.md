# GearSandbox
GearSandbox is a mechanical advantage simulator. Users can create trains of gears and hang weights from them to simulate the net forces and torques that all of the components would experience. The simulation's user interface enables users to create and delete gears, to experiment with concentric vs. coupled gear relationships, to run multiple gear trains at the same time, and to zoom in and out to achieve the desired view. Though the "gears" don't have any teeth, they are unnecessary for this project to fulfill its purpose: to offer an easy-to-use and realistic Newtonian physics simulator.

GearSandbox has two forms: a raw simulator and a game. The raw simulator can be found earlier in this repository's commit history. In its current form, this repository contains the GearSandbox game, called Tension.

## Tension Overview
Tension is a game of physics and mental math. Players seek to balance the two weights from the raw GearSandbox simulator by chaining gears of predetermined, natural-number radii in the correct order. The game uses an algorithm to generate lists of required gears and weights to balance. As users become familiar with the game (and useful strategies), the algorithm increases the number of required gears.

The game contains a brief tutorial on how to use its user interface. It also contains a learning guide that informs players about the physics behind the game.

GearSandbox and Tension were created by Max Scholle in June 2024. Credits are available through the Tension game menu.
